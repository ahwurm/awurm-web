## 🚀 Quick Reference - Working Configuration

### Final Working `amplify.yml`
```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
      - .next/cache/**/*
```

### Key Settings
- **baseDirectory**: `.next` (NOT `out`)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (NOT `npm run build:static`)
- **Framework**: Auto-detected as Next.js (no manual override needed)
- **Next.js Config**: `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`

---

## 🎯 The Critical Discovery

### **Next.js 14+ Requirement**

**The breakthrough**: AWS documentation states:
> *"In Next.js version 14, if you are deploying an app where an amplify.yml file is present, you must manually set the baseDirectory to .next in the file regardless of SSG or SSR."*

**Key Insight**: Next.js 14+ changed where static export files are placed:
- **Next.js 13 and earlier**: Static files go in `out/` directory
- **Next.js 14+**: All files (including static exports) go in `.next/` directory

### **Why This Matters**
1. AWS Amplify looks for `required-server-files.json` in the `baseDirectory`
2. This file is **only generated in `.next/`** (not in `out/`)
3. Using `baseDirectory: out` causes the error: *"Can't find required-server-files.json"*
4. The build succeeds, but deployment fails during post-build validation

## 🔍 Complete Troubleshooting Journey

### Timeline of Issues and Solutions

#### **Issue 1: Initial HTTP 500 Error**
- **Problem**: Website showed HTTP 500 error
- **Initial Diagnosis**: Server-side code in static hosting environment
- **Attempted Fix**: Changed `npm run build` to `npm run build:static` in amplify.yml
- **Result**: Build succeeded but still failed validation

#### **Issue 2: "required-server-files.json not found"**
- **Problem**: AWS Amplify couldn't find required server files
- **Attempted Fix #1**: Removed `appRoot` from amplify.yml
- **Result**: Same error persisted

#### **Issue 3: Framework Detection Issues**
- **Problem**: Amplify treating as Next.js server app instead of static site
- **Attempted Fix #2**: Added `framework: web` to force static site detection
- **Result**: Same error still occurred

#### **Issue 4: The Root Cause Discovery**
- **Investigation**: Deep dive into AWS documentation and version-specific requirements
- **Discovery**: Next.js 14+ requires `baseDirectory: .next` regardless of static export
- **Final Fix**: Updated amplify.yml with correct baseDirectory and standard build command
- **Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Deployment worked perfectly

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### **Pitfall 1: Using Wrong baseDirectory**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG (Next.js 14+)
artifacts:
  baseDirectory: out

# ✅ CORRECT (Next.js 14+)
artifacts:
  baseDirectory: .next
```

### **Pitfall 2: Using Wrong Build Command**
```yaml
# ❌ PROBLEMATIC
build:
  commands:
    - npm run build:static

# ✅ CORRECT
build:
  commands:
    - npm run build
```

### **Pitfall 3: Framework Override Issues**
```yaml
# ❌ UNNECESSARY (can cause issues)
frontend:
  framework: web

# ✅ BETTER (let AWS auto-detect)
frontend:
  # No framework specified - auto-detection works
```

### **Pitfall 4: Version Confusion**
- **Next.js 13**: Use `baseDirectory: out` for static exports
- **Next.js 14+**: Use `baseDirectory: .next` for everything
- **Key Files**: `required-server-files.json` only exists in `.next/`

## 📋 Future Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Verify Next.js version in `package.json`
- [ ] Confirm `next.config.js` has `output: 'export'`
- [ ] Test local build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Check `.next/required-server-files.json` exists
- [ ] Verify `amplify.yml` uses correct baseDirectory for version

### Deployment Process
1. **Commit changes to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor AWS Amplify Console**
   - Watch build logs in real-time
   - Check for "Build completed successfully"
   - Verify no "required-server-files.json" errors

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - [ ] Visit awurm.com to confirm site loads
   - [ ] Test all major pages (research, projects, speaking, about)
   - [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Check build logs** in AWS Amplify console
2. **Look for specific error messages**:
   - "required-server-files.json not found" → Check baseDirectory
   - "Framework detection" issues → Verify amplify.yml structure
   - Build failures → Check package.json dependencies
3. **Compare with working configuration** in this document

## 🔧 Error Reference Guide

### "Can't find required-server-files.json"
- **Cause**: Wrong baseDirectory in amplify.yml
- **Solution**: Use `baseDirectory: .next` for Next.js 14+
- **Verification**: Check if file exists locally in `.next/`

### HTTP 500 Error on Site
- **Cause**: Server-side code in static hosting or deployment failure
- **Solution**: Ensure proper static export configuration
- **Check**: Build logs, amplify.yml settings, next.config.js

### Build Succeeds But Site Won't Load
- **Cause**: Incorrect artifact directory or missing files
- **Solution**: Verify baseDirectory matches where Next.js puts files
- **Test**: Local build and check output directory

### Framework Detection Issues
- **Cause**: Conflicting amplify.yml settings
- **Solution**: Remove manual framework overrides, let AWS auto-detect
- **Verify**: Check AWS Amplify console app settings

## 📊 Deployment History Insights

### What Didn't Work
1. **Manual framework override** (`framework: web`) - caused detection conflicts
2. **Custom build script** (`npm run build:static`) - unnecessary complexity
3. **baseDirectory: out** - wrong for Next.js 14+
4. **Removing appRoot** - wasn't the root issue

### What Worked
1. **Standard Next.js build** with `output: 'export'`
2. **Correct baseDirectory** for Next.js version
3. **Letting AWS auto-detect** the framework
4. **Following version-specific documentation**

### Key Learning
> The most critical factor was understanding that **Next.js 14+ fundamentally changed where static export files are placed**, and AWS Amplify documentation for this was buried in version-specific notes.

## 🎉 Final Notes

This deployment journey taught us that **version-specific requirements** are critical when working with rapidly evolving frameworks like Next.js. The key was finding the specific AWS documentation for Next.js 14+ that explained the baseDirectory requirement.

**For future Claude sessions**: Start with this configuration and only modify if you encounter specific issues. The current setup is battle-tested and working perfectly.

**Site Status**: ✅ awurm.com is live and fully functional!
